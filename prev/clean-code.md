# Clean code is

- easy to change
- easy to understand
    - low cognitive load
    - low learning curve
- safe/secure
- correct (it works)
- relevant
- highly subjective


How do you get there:

- use good variable names
- single responsibility principle: do one thing, do it well (class, func, file)
- follow known patterns such as "design patterns" if they exist
- DRY: Don't repeat yourself (mostly)
- SOLID, encapsulation--information hiding
- principle of least surprise
- idiomatic
- code to interfaces, not implementations
-
